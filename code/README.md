The benchmark can be run by:
//TODO: Explain benchmark

## Prerequisites

In order to run the benchmark XLATE and OpenSSL 1.1.1b have to be downloaded and built. If you have not yet cloned the submodule xlate in the originalcode directory you can do this by running

	# sh clone-xlate.sh


Afterwards you can build OpenSSL and XLATE by running

	#sh install-xlate.sh


Now that both OpenSSL 1.1.1b and XLATE are built you are able to run the benchmark.
